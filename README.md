## Problem Statement
Traditional **Rotating Savings and Credit Associations (ROSCA)** face several risks and challenges:

1. **Security Risks**:  
   - Group contributions are often stolen or lost due to physical factors such as fire outbreaks.  
   - Marketers and business owners contributing daily face the danger of treasurers being robbed, sometimes even at gunpoint, before reaching home.  

2.  **Inefficiency**:  
   - Managing records and ensuring transparency within the group often relies on manual methods, which are prone to errors and fraud.

3.**Accountability Issues**:  
   - Borrowers may refuse to repay loans or deny borrowing altogether, leading to disputes and financial losses.  

## Solution
Savichain addresses these challenges through the following innovations:

1. **Blockchain Technology**:  
   - Digitizes group contributions and disbursements to eliminate physical risks such as theft or loss.  
   - Provides an immutable and transparent ledger for all transactions, ensuring trust among members.

2. **Enhanced Security**:  
   - Contributions are securely stored on the blockchain, making them resistant to theft or physical damage.
     
3. **Ease of Access**:  
   - A user-friendly interface ensures all members can easily participate and monitor group activities without requiring technical expertise.
     
4. **Accountability Mechanisms**:  
   - Smart contracts make sure borrowers stick to their repayment terms, helping to reduce defaults and ensuring that group funds are returned.
  
5. **Smart Contracts**:  
   - Automates processes like loan disbursements, repayments, and contribution tracking, reducing manual errors and disputes.
